# Monitoring and Security Based Bash Scripts üìúüõ°Ô∏è

## Description
**Monitoring and Security Based Bash Scripts** is a collection of quirky yet practical bash scripts that I initially wrote for my personal projects. These scripts address specific needs, primarily focusing on system monitoring and security tasks. Though originally made for my own use, I thought it might be fun to share them with the world. Whether you're just curious, looking to learn, or have similar needs for your own projects, feel free to explore and experiment. Who knows, you might find them useful or even want to contribute! üí°

## More Information
This project is a fun and spontaneous collection of bash scripts that I use to meet various needs. While a few might need minor tweaks, they generally perform well for their intended purposes.  

### Why Open Source? üåç
I‚Äôm a firm believer in open-source software. Open-source contributions benefit the tech ecosystem by allowing people to learn, share, and improve. While some situations may require closed-source code for security or proprietary reasons, in most cases, open-source is the way to go ‚Äî benefiting everyone!

## Available Scripts
This repository contains several useful scripts, each with a specific purpose:

### 1. Simple Fast Network Monitor üåê
A script that provides real-time network data, including VPN, Tor, and Proxy statuses, forwarded ports, and more. Color-coded indicators make it easy to assess your network state at a glance.

### 2. Bitcoin Crypto Monitor and Analyzer ‚Çø
Monitors essential Bitcoin node metrics, such as block height, mempool status, wallet balance, Tor routing, and more. Perfect for Bitcoin developers and node operators needing constant performance data.

### 3. USB Version Control üíæ
A lightweight, offline version control system for those who prefer backing up code physically on a USB drive. This is a handy solution for people who want to avoid using public or cloud-based version control systems.

## How to Use üöÄ

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
